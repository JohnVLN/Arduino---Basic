## Objective
Basic simulation of an alarm.
The LCD displays a message and a LED light blinks.

Using `<LiquidCrystal.h>` library to communicate with the display.

Since I don't have a sensor for air quality and a buzzer, the test will only simulate with the LCD.
For the future, provide the sensor and develop a proper project.
